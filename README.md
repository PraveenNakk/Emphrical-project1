# Emphrical-project1
The steps to run our project code are as follows. firstly, grab the datasets from the Kaggle repository. We uploaded these files to my github account and also gave a link in the report. Get Emipircal.ipynb from github. Open Google Collaboratory or Jupiter Notebook and upload the.ipynb file that was downloaded. Also, load the datasets. run every code block.
